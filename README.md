# AutoProgressBar
A progress bar wrapper class for any function or iterable of functions.
Progress is currently determined by the number of functions in the iterable that have been called. 
Yield functionality (unknown?) -- haven't really tested it yet, but should work fine. Might need minor change for that to work.
